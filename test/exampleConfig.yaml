# Default all namespaces are checked. If you wish you can provide a list of namespaces to check.
#
#namespaces:
#  - test
#  - kube-system

# By default DockerHub, Quay, gcr.io, k8s.gcr.io and Zalando repository are configured
# If your images are using one of these registries the version fetching will work automatically
#
#imageRegistries: 
# If you need to fetch private images on the registries please override the authentication method and username/password
# If all your images are comming from your own registry but all the images are coming for example from the DockerHub 
# or you want to fetch versions by default from one of these registries regardles of the registry specified in the image
# then please set default to true
#
#  dockerHub:
#    username: 
#    password:
#    default: true or false
#  quay:
#    username: 
#    password: 
#    authType: # Can be basic or token
#    default: true or false
#  gcr:
#    username: 
#    password:

#    default: true or false 

# If you have a private registry you can configure it here. But if you want to fetch new versions from another registry 
# you can specify also specify one of the default registries. You can specify multiple urls that need to be overridden.

#  overrideRegistries: 
#    - registry: # If you want to specify your registry

#      urls:
#        - some.url.io

# If only some of the images need to use a different registry then you can specify your own registry or you
# can select one of the default ones. This always takes precedent above all the above registry configuration

#      images:
#        - test/something # Name of the image, you can also use regular expressions

# There will always be images that the LCM currently can't find, because you run them somwhere else outside of Kuberneres
# Until LCM can find them automatically you can specify them by hand
#images:
#  - test/some:1.1.2 # please provide the full url unless it's docker hub
#  - registry.io/test/some:1.2.1
